### help create the future

There are many struggles and conflicts that I (and others) face that would be easy to resolve if I just magically knew everything. Sadly this probably will never happen, but it's also pretty exciting that with each generation, we're becoming more and more advanced.

> We see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature.

I understand that all of modern knowledge and convenience has been made possible by the contributions of countless people before us. And perhaps one day in the future, the lives of humans (or whatever we'll evolve into) will be unbelievably amazing, in a way completely incomprehensible to us now.

I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, and I want to make the giants even taller.

### act based on love

My experience is possible thanks to cooperation between trillions of cells.

But it's much more than just cooperation: the parts of my body work in such great harmony that more often than not, I conceptualize myself not as a collection of countless pieces, but as an individual.

In a sense, the cells that make up my body "gave up on their individuality" in order to become part of something bigger, and I'm super greatful for that.

I want to think, speak, and act in a way that dissolves the boundaries between myself, my family, and my community.

And the fact that loving other people feels amazing doesn't hurt. ðŸ™‚

### be proud of myself

One big difference between me (a part of society) and my cells (a part of me) is that my cells don't have self-awareness (as far as I'm aware). They can't think about the past or make plans for the future, but luckily they've come together in a way that allows me to do it.

- I've made huge mistakes in the past, but I am using those experiences to learn & grow into an ideal self.
- I understand that some things are out of my control, but I am still living deliberately.
- I need to consider the consequences before acting on a radical idea, but I am still taking risks.
- My knowledge is incomplete and my mindset might be flawed, but I am still able to do great things.
- Success has never beenâ€”and will never beâ€”a guarantee, but that will never stop me from pursuing something I have passion for.
