### be proud of myself

I've made huge mistakes, but I'm using those experiences to learn & grow into an ideal self.

I understand that some things are out of my control, but I am still living deliberately.

I need to consider the consequences before acting on a radical idea, but I am still taking risks.

My knowledge is incomplete and my mindset might be flawed, but I am still able to do great things.

There are multiple ways I could be more healthy and better at time management, but I'm still doing a great job and will continue to improve.

Success has never beenâ€”and will never beâ€”a guarantee, but I am still pursuing the things I have passion for.

### help create the future

> We see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature.

On the one hand, our society has made an incredible amount of progress in a very short time, but on the other hand, there's still just so much wrong with the world. It seems like there's no way everything will be resolved within my lifetime, but if I can help pave the way for a future generation to do it, that would be so awesome.

### act based on love

The trillions of cells in my body have come together to create something with a greater capacity for strength, intelligence, and compassion than would ever be possible for a cell on its own. It's more than just cooperation: I see myself not as a collection of parts working together, but as an individual.

In some ways, the concept of myself as indivisible but separate from the rest of the universe is completely arbitrary.

I believe that the more we can rely on each other, the more our society will thrive. I want to think, speak, and act in a way that dissolves the boundaries between myself, my family, and my community.

And the fact that loving other people feels amazing doesn't hurt. ðŸ™‚
